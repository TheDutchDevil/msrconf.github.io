| 2017 | [How Long Will It Take to Fix This Bug?](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1269017) <br/> Cathrin Weiss, Rahul Premraj, Thomas Zimmermann, and Andreas Zeller <br/> "For paving the way of actionable software analytics." |
| 2016 | [Mining email social networks (MSR 2006)](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1138016) <br/> Christian Bird, Alex Gourley, Prem Devanbu, Michael Gertz and Anand Swaminathan <br/> "For their fundational influence on studies of socio-technical activities in software projects." |
| 2015 | [When do changes induce fixes? (MSR 2005)](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1083147) <br/> Jacek Sliwerski, Thomas Zimmermann, and Andreas Zeller <br/> "Prior software quality research focused on flagging files with bugs, but the SZZ algorithm by Sliwerski et al. was the first work to focus on flagging faulty changes. By flagging bugs before they get into the code, follow-up research has taken a preventive role instead of a catchup role." |
| 2014 | [Preprocessing CVS Data for Fine-Grained Analysis (MSR 2004)](https://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/papers/msr2004/msr2004.pdf) <br/> Thomas Zimmermann and Peter Weißgerber <br/> "For clearly and engagingly presenting practices that stood at the core of early MSR approaches, thus lowering the entry barrier for the researchers worldwide to join this emerging field." |
