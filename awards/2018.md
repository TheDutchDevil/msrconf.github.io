Mining Software Repositories Awards 2018

Call for Nominations 
The Mining Software Repositories community has started a series of two new awards, the MSR Early Career Achievement Award and the MSR Foundational Contribution Award. 

MSR Early Career Achievement Award
This award recognizes outstanding junior researchers who provided outstanding contributions in the area of mining software repositories. The award recognizes research outputs produced by candidates during the early stages of their career. To be eligible, a candidateâ€™s most recent computer-related educational degree (baccalaureate, masters, or doctoral degree) must have been awarded no more than seven years prior to the date of nomination. 

MSR Foundational Contribution Award
The MSR Foundational Contribution Award recognizes individuals, or groups of individuals, having produced fundamental contributions in the field of mining software repositories, which helped many others (not limited to the MSR community) to build on it to advance the state of the art. It could be a tool, a dataset, a repository, or a mixture of contributions opening a new research areas. It is not a requirement that such a research contribution has been presented in MSR at some point. Having received other recognitions for the same contribution does not preclude an individual to be nominated for the MSR Foundational Contribution Award.
