# Mining Software Repositories Awards 2020

## Call for Nominations
The Mining Software Repositories community has introduced a series of two awards, the MSR Ric Holt Early Career Achievement Award and the MSR Foundational Contribution Award.

### MSR Ric Holt Early Career Achievement Award
This award recognizes outstanding junior researchers who have provided outstanding contributions in the area of mining software repositories. The award recognizes research outputs produced by candidates during the early stages of their career. To be eligible, a candidate’s most recent computer-related educational degree (baccalaureate, masters, or doctoral degree) must have been awarded on or after January 1, 2013. If the degree included a defense, the defense must have occurred on or after January 1, 2013. If the degree included a thesis, but did not require a defense, then the final submission of the thesis must have occurred on or after January 1, 2013. The award is named after Dr. Ric Holt (1941 – 2019) who was a professor at the University of Waterloo.

For the **MSR 2020 Early Career Achievement Award**, the recipient is **Alberto Bacchelli** for contributions to the state of the art in research and practice in modern code reviews, as well as outreach and education efforts throughout the international MSR community.

### MSR Foundational Contribution Award
The MSR Foundational Contribution Award recognizes individuals, or groups of individuals, having produced fundamental contributions in the field of mining software repositories, **which helped many others (not limited to the MSR community) to build on it to advance the state of the art**. It could be a tool, a dataset, a repository, or a mixture of contributions opening new research areas. It is not a requirement that such a research contribution has been presented at the MSR conference at some point. Having received other recognitions for the same contribution does not preclude an individual from being nominated for the MSR Foundational Contribution Award.

**The 2020 MSR Foundational Contribution Award** went to **Jonathan Maletic** and **Michael Collard**, for the srcML infrastructure, which addresses many hard problems in source code parsing and has fostered a wide range of research innovations throughout software engineering.
